# Aura

## Overview

Aura was conceived when my group mates and I decided to do something a little different for our final project. We are all very artsy types, so we wanted to engage our users' senses in a novel way. The result was an app inspired by Synesthesia, which is a medical condition which causes those who have it to see sound or hear colour. We tried to capture this digitally.

## The Build

We used: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Gulp, Heroku, Github, jQuery, SCSS/SASS, CSS Animate, Angular.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular-Color-Picker 

The users can choose to play any of an array of sounds we have seeded into a database. We don't identify the sounds, which is part of the fun. After they have done so, they will be taken to the sound show page, where they may listen to the sound and choose a colour they feel accurately represents the sound. This is done via an Angular Color Picker that pops up when they hit the button to select a colour. Then, they can click on the Save Color button, to which we've attached a function which splices the hash away from the CSS HEX value. Then the users hit the See Results button, which pushes the augmented hex value into an empty array. The users are then taken to the results page, where they can see colours that have been selected by other users in a flashing background animation. We also include an animation related to the sound selected, which might help our users guess what it is!

The styling, which we believe is the high point of the app, was done using pure CSS animation

## Pluses

It was great working on this project because I had team members with such similar vision. We all very much value the arts and were delighted to work on an app that so directly appealed to all of us. This was a pleasant contrast to the initial difficulties with my other group project.

## Challenges

Though I loved the fact that we were all so creative, it had some unique downsides. In my experience at GA, I've noticed many artists think very conceptually and have trouble with the hard logic of coding. This was very much the case here. We had many wonderful ideas that we weren't always sure how to execute. Also, as Git Master, I had some trouble figuring out how to work with Git Branches.

## Potential Developments

My group might want to add a functionality that allows users to create animations that represent the sounds they hear, in addition to picking colours. This could become a valuable new source of inspiration for creative types.

## Overall

I loved working with this group. We tackled some of the challenges we faced with good humour and lots of support for one another and I discovered this is exactly the vibe I want out of a new workplace.
